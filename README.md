# california_covid_cohort_study
How does vaccination impact the COVID-19 epidemic in California? We set out to understand and quantify it by analyzing the publicly available dataset from
https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-post-vaccination-infection-data. For this study, we focused on three specific time periods: The Delta Wave, the Omicron Wave, and the period
before the Delta Wave (we call it the Pre-Delta Period). We used a retrospective cohort study to study cases, deaths, and hospitalizations between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated individuals and compare the difference in their rates. We used measures such as incidence risk ratios, odds ratios, attributable fraction of the unexposed,
population prevented fraction, attributable risk reduction, and number needed to treat to measure the effect of the vaccine. All of these statistics show significant impact of the 
vaccinations on reducing cases, deaths, and hospitalizations among the vaccinated population.
